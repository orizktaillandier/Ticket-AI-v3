# Security Checklist for GitHub Push

## ✅ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- [x] `.env` file with real API key has been backed up to `.env.backup` (NOT in git)
- [x] `.env` file replaced with placeholder values
- [x] `.env.example` created with template configuration
- [x] `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` files

### 2. API Keys & Credentials
- [x] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [x] OpenAI API key loaded via environment variable only
- [x] No database credentials (using mock data only)
- [x] No Zoho API credentials (demo doesn't use real Zoho API)

### 3. Company Data
- [x] All dealer names are mock (Dealership_1, Dealership_2, etc.)
- [x] All contact names are mock (Support Agent_1, Support Agent_2, etc.)
- [x] All rep names are mock (Rep_1, Rep_2, Rep_3)
- [x] All revenue data is mock/fictional
- [x] No real client information included
- [x] Only public company names used (AutoTrader, Kijiji, Facebook - all public platforms)

### 4. Files Excluded from Git
Files in `.gitignore`:
- `venv/` - Python virtual environment
- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode
- `*.pyc` - Compiled Python files
- `auth.json` - Any auth files
- `*.env` - Environment files
- `.env` - Main environment file
- `.env.*` - All environment variants
- `zoho_auth.json` - Zoho credentials
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/` - IDE settings
- `*.zip`, `*.rar`, `*.7z` - Archives
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` - OS files

### 5. Mock Data Verification
All data files use fictional/mock data:
- `demo/data/dealer_revenue.json` - Mock ARR values and packages
- `demo/mock_data/sample_tickets.json` - Mock tickets with generic content
- No real customer names, emails, or phone numbers
- No real ticket content from production systems

## 🔒 Before Each Git Push

1. **Check for secrets:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "sk-proj-" . --exclude-dir={venv,.git}
   grep -r "OPENAI_API_KEY.*sk-" . --exclude-dir={venv,.git}
   ```

2. **Verify .env is not tracked:**
   ```bash
   git status | grep ".env"
   ```
   (Should show nothing)

3. **Check git diff before committing:**
   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

4. **Review files being committed:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

- Any file containing `sk-proj-` or `sk-` followed by long strings
- Email addresses with real domains
- Phone numbers
- Real dealership names
- Real employee names
- Production URLs or endpoints
- Database connection strings

## ✅ Safe to Push

The following are SAFE and intentionally included:
- Company name references (e.g., "Zoho Desk" - it's a public product)
- Public platform names (AutoTrader, Kijiji, Facebook - all public)
- Generic titles (Support Agent, Dealer Support Specialist)
- Mock/demo data files
- Documentation and README files
- Code without credentials

## 📝 Your Real API Key Location

**IMPORTANT:** Your real OpenAI API key is saved in:
`demo/.env.backup`

This file is:
- ❌ NOT tracked by git
- ❌ NOT included in repository
- ✅ Safe on your local machine only
- ✅ Use this to restore after cloning

## 🔄 To Restore API Key Locally

After cloning the repo:
```bash
cd demo
cp .env.backup .env  # Restore your real key
```

Or manually edit `demo/.env` and replace the placeholder with your actual key.
